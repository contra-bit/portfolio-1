Notes and exercises from the various books about software engineering and computer science that I've read. All notes
are written in **markdown** format with embedded **LaTeX** equations. They can be compiled to HTML with `kramdown` and
viewed in the browser (with the MathJax library for rendering any math blocks), or, conveniently, converted to either
LaTeX or HTML style PDFs using the `compile_notes/compile.sh` utility. Usage:

```
bash compile_notes/compile.sh html|latex path/to/file.md
```
