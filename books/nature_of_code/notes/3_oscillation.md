# chapter 3: oscillaton
## radians vs degrees
A circle has 360$^\circ$ degrees, and $2\pi$ radians. One radian equals the radius of the circle. *Angular
acceleration* influences an *angular velocity*, which in turns changes the *angle* of an object relative to a fulcrum.

## oscillations
An *oscillation* is a periodic movement between two points. *Simple harmonic motion* is the periodic, sinusoidal
oscillation of an object. Simple harmonic motion is a function of time, with:

  * *amplitude*: the distance from the center of motion to the extremity
  * *period*: the duration of one complete cycle. The inverse of *frequency*.
