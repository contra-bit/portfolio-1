# chapter 7: cellular automata
Stephen Wolfram touches on cellular automata in *A New Kind of Science*. Stanislaw Ulam/John von Neumann discovered
the idea of cellular automata in the 40s, but it didn't gain widespread popularity until Conway's *Game of Life* in the
70s.

Waclaw Sierpinski patented the *Sierpinski Triangle*.

**Wolfram classification** of cellular automata:
  1. **uniformity**: every cell ends up constant
  2. **repetition**: the end result is stability, but with repeating changes
  3. **random**: have no easily discernible pattern
  4. **complexity**: a mix between classes 2 and 3
