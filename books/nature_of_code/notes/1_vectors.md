# chapter 1: vectors
A *Euclidean*, or *geometric*, **vector** is an entity that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. Vectors are typically
written in **boldface** or with an overscored arrow.


## addition/subtraction
$$
\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v} \\
w_x = u_x + v_x \\
w_y = u_y + v_y
$$

## multiplication
### scalar
$$
\vec{w} = \vec{u} * n \\
w_x = u_x * n \\
w_y = u_y * n
$$

## magnitude
The *magnitude*, or length, of a vector is computed using the Pythagorean theorem.

$$
\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{{v_x}^2 + {v_y}^2}
$$

## normalization
*Normalizing* a vector is the act of reducing it to a magnitude of 1, or turning it into a *unit vector* (represented
as $\hat{v}$).

$$
\hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{\|\vec{v}\|}
$$
