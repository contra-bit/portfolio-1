# chapter 0: introduction
A distribution of values clustered around an average, or *mean*, is called a *normal*, *Gaussian*, or *Laplacian*
distribution, and is represented by a "bell" curve generated by a function relating:

  * mean (Greek *mu*)
  * standard deviation (Greek *sigma*)

To calculate *standard deviation*, find the square root of the average of the squared differences between the mean and
every data point.

In a *Gaussian random walk*, the distance travelled by the walker per tick is determined by a normal distribution.

To reduce the amount of *oversampling* in a random walk, or retracing steps over areas already covered, perform a large
step every once in a while: this is called a *Levy flight*.

*Perlin noise*, devised by Ken Perlin, generates a smooth sequence of random numbers. Perlin noise generators operate
in multiple dimensions:

  * in 1, the generator creates a linear sequence of values for points in time
  * in 2, the generator creates a 2-dimensional sequence of values where any given value is similar to each of its 8
    neighbors.
