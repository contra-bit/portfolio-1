# chapter 6: assembler

An assembler is a program that translates assembly language to machine code (binary instructions). Human readable
mnemonics are far easier to work with, so it's in developers' best interest to use the high-level representation of machine
language.

The assembler generally does the following:

  * parse input
  * identify/resolve symbols
  * convert instructions to binary equivalents
