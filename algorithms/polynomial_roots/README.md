# polynomial roots
A primitive implementation of [Newton's method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method) for estimating the roots
of a polynomial (neither the derivative nor the seed estimate are actually computed, but rather hard-coded for a single
example). The algorithm is implemented in `polynomial_roots.polynomial_root()`; running the file will print the
estimated root for a test case.
