# portfolio
A collection of miscellaneous work: algorithm/data-structure implementations, one-off scripts that demonstrate
something interesting or helped me learn something new, notes from courses/books, and everything in between. Here are
some choice examples:

  * [a JSON parser](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/tree/develop/misc/json_parser_c) (C)
  * [notes and projects](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/tree/develop/books/nand2tetris) from **The Elements of Computing Systems** (Nand2Tetris)
  * a [self-contained RSA implementation](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/blob/develop/algorithms/encryption/rsa.py) (Python)
  * [prime number spirals visualization](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/tree/develop/visualizations/prime_number_spirals) (Javascript)
  * a [Scheme interpreter](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/tree/develop/misc/scheme_interpreter) (Haskell)
  * a self-balancing [AVL tree](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/tree/develop/data_structures/avl_tree) (C)
  * [slides from a talk](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/blob/develop/presentations/math_and_logic_in_hardware.md) I gave on math and logic in hardware
  * the [Rabin-Miller primality test](https://github.com/sevko/portfolio/blob/develop/algorithms/rabin_miller/RabinMiller.hs) (Haskell)
